Instructions:

A Simple light-weight Swift IDE with limited support for syntax highlighting.


Steps To Get Up And Running (these only need to be done one time):

Copy the scripts from the Scripts folder to the project runtime directory / location of the compiled .app file. This is also printed in Xcode when you compile and run.
Make sure to update the paths in the 'updatemain' script to reflect your runtime directory.

Build and Run and you are set. 

Output is displayed natively. Errors from coding in the IDE will be reported in the Xcode console.
