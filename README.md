## Instructions:
These only need to be done the first time.

Copy the scripts from the Scripts folder to the project runtime directory / location of the compiled .app file. This location is also printed in the Xcode console when you compile and run.

Make sure to update the paths in the 'updatemain' script to reflect your runtime directory.

Build and Run and you are set. Output is displayed natively. Errors from coding in the IDE will be reported in the Xcode console.
